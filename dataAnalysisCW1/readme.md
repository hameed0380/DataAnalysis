A data analysis assignment that incorporated using machine learning (recieved a first class)
cannot disclose the exact questions

Learning outcomes assessed
• How to develop, validate, and evaluate a simple machine-learning algorithm.
• How to implement a gradient descent algorithm and run it on a given data
set to train a machine learning model.
• How to use the trained models to perform data analysis tasks.
• How to write a detailed data analysis report based on a set of numerical
simulations and draw statistical conclusions from the obtained results.
